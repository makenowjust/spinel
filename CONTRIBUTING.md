# Contributing to Spinel

## Before you open a pull request

**Run `make gate` on your branch, merged with the current `master`, and
paste its summary into the pull request.** The gate builds the compiler and
runs every leg we merge on: the test corpus, the benchmarks, optcarrot, the
ruby/spec retention gate, scale-test, spin-check and the other property
tests. A pull request is merged only after the same gate passes here.

`gate-test-shared` also runs the whole test corpus, including bundled packages,
with `SPINEL_SHARE_STRINGS=1` and `OPT=-O1`. It reuses `GATE_CACHE` with the flag
in the key. `test/share/known-failures.txt` lists the current failures, one
program name per line (`#` comments allowed). An unlisted failure fails the
gate; a listed program that passes prints a reminder to remove it. `infer-test`
and `reject-test` run only with their default-build expectations.

```sh
git fetch origin && git merge origin/master   # or rebase
make gate 2>&1 | tee gate.log
grep -E 'Tests:|scale-test|gate-test-shared:|gate:' gate.log
```

**If `make gate` fails on our side, we fix it where the fix is mechanical** (a
recorded list such as `test/collect/refusals.expected`, a test whose output
depends on an order the implementation chooses) and say what we changed in the
pull request. A failure that needs a design decision goes back to you with a
comment naming the failing leg.

**If your branch conflicts with `master` or with other open pull requests, we
resolve it** and say how in the pull request. Many pull requests touch the same
functions, so keep a branch small; a smaller one conflicts less and is quicker
to take.

## Issues and pull requests

**A pull request needs no issue.** A bug fix with its reproducer as a test,
and the `spinel diff` report if the answer differs from CRuby's, goes in as
one self-contained pull request. Do not open an issue first and then a pull
request for it a few minutes later: it costs the same review twice.

**An open issue means "I will not work on this", or "let us talk".** If you
mean to fix something, open a draft pull request straight away; that is also
how others see it is taken. If you only want to report it, or will not get to
it, open an issue and someone else may pick it up. Issues are also the place
for discussion: a direction to decide, a proposal, a question.

**Describe the why, not the history.** A pull request that fixes a bug needs
a few lines: what was wrong, and the reproducer. Write more when the change is
a design decision (what you chose and what you rejected); do not retell how
the implementation got there or link every related issue.

## The gate in the commit

Run `make hooks` once: it points git at the hooks in `tools/hooks`. When
`make gate` passes, it records the tree it tested and the `master` it was
merged with. `git commit --amend --no-edit` then adds a trailer such as

```
Gate: green tree c5355fd0df33 master c55f919a6452 (linux-aarch64 gcc-14.2.0) tests 5642/0
```

The trailer goes only on a commit that, merged with that `master`, gives
exactly the tested tree; a commit that changed after the gate loses it.
A rebase or any other rewrite keeps the trailer's text but not its truth.
`ruby tools/gate.rb verify <commit>` checks it the same way and says OK,
MISMATCH or NO GATE TRAILER. The pre-commit hook (`ruby tools/gate.rb
check`) refuses a commit that grows `emit_call_body` or any function over
1,000 lines, adds a test whose `.expected` differs from CRuby run with
`--enable-frozen-string-literal` (unless the test is marked
`# spinel: not-cruby`, below), or writes to a fixed `/tmp` path. Where the
gate can't pass natively, `ruby tools/gate.rb linux` runs it in a Linux
container on this branch merged with `master`, and records the same stamp.

`make gate`'s stamp and the `.expected` comparison use `GATE_RUBY`, else
`ruby` from `PATH` when it is Ruby 4.0 or later (`tools/gate-ruby` picks
it); the hooks run under `GATE_RUBY` or `ruby`. Without such a Ruby,
`make gate` skips the stamp and passes or fails exactly as it would
otherwise, and the `.expected` comparison is skipped with a warning. `make gate-tool-test`
tests `tools/gate.rb` itself and the shared corpus's known-failure summary.

`make share-verify-test` compiles `test/share/*.rb`, `test/share_strings_*.rb`
and `test/share/verify/**/*.rb` with `SPINEL_SHARE_STRINGS=1 --repr-check --plan-check`.
It fails on a new conflict, a failed compilation, or generated C that differs
with the checking flags, or an output mismatch. Each executable program runs
once against its `.expected`, without GC stress. The 13 examples under
`test/share/verify/conflicts/` remain compile-only; their expected files record
CRuby answers that the compiler does not yet produce. Verifier fixtures have
no `share` marker and do not join `share-strings-test`. A stale entry in `test/share/verify-conflicts.txt`
prints a removal reminder and does not fail the target. The ratchet contains
exact diagnostics, one per line; remove an entry when its disagreement is fixed.
`SHARE_VERIFY_JOBS` controls parallelism (default 2).
Use `ruby tools/share_verify.rb -v` for classified observations and coverage
gaps, or pass Ruby files to check a focused subset. `--extra DIR` includes
another directory's Ruby files. This target is separate from `make gate`.

The String channel shadow records the existing return-tail analysis and
observes publishing reads, fresh-tail clearing, nil guards at pickups, and
the existing polymorphic arm records. Boxed proc/block results use their
own value channel. `channel-unobserved` identifies a publication or target
the shadow cannot verify; it is not a clean bill of health. In particular,
the shadow does not yet prove channel preservation across an ensure body
that publishes another value. The ordinary repr shadow still checks boxes
and coercions; not every handwritten argument or element store uses it.

## What the review checks

- **Same answer as CRuby, or a refusal.** Compare a new test's output with
  CRuby 4.0 run with `--enable-frozen-string-literal`: Spinel's string
  literals are always frozen. A path Spinel cannot handle is refused at
  compile time with a `spinel: FILE:LINE: ...` message naming the construct.
  A program Spinel compiles must behave as CRuby does: it must not give a
  different answer silently, raise an error CRuby would not raise (a
  `NoMethodError` for a method that was never defined, a
  `NotImplementedError` for an unsupported construct), or fail in the C
  compiler. Turning a refusal into a runtime `NotImplementedError` is only
  for `--defer-refusals`, which a user asks for explicitly.
  `docs/limitations.md` describes the refusals; when a change supports or
  refuses a construct, update its entry in the same pull request.
- **No cost where the change does not apply.** If optcarrot's generated C
  changes, show callgrind numbers; its checksum stays 59662. A rise of more
  than 0.05 in any scale-test ratio is a finding.
- **Tests that run everywhere.**
  - A test whose values pass 2^31 (including through `to_r`, `**` or a
    Bignum) starts with `# spinel: int64`; the 32-bit lane runs every other
    test.
  - A test whose `.expected` is Spinel's own answer and legitimately differs
    from CRuby's (a refusal message, a Spinel-only API) carries
    `# spinel: not-cruby` and a reason in its first lines; the pre-commit
    hook then does not compare it with CRuby.
  - Use `Dir.tmpdir` for temporary files, not a fixed `/tmp` path, and no
    OS-specific paths.
  - Give every new test its `.expected` file.
  - A new test registers itself with these header lines; no Makefile edit:
    `# spinel: share` runs it under `--share-strings`, `# spinel: gc-minor`
    runs it with the minor mark off, on, and under the generational verifier
    with GC stress, and `# spinel: gc-stress` runs stress level 2 with and
    without the full verifier. Use one line per marker.
    `# spinel: reject-share` marks a `test/reject/` program that runs under
    `--share-strings`, with its output in `test/share/reject/`.
    `# spinel: wasm` selects the WASI smoke tests; `# spinel: decisions`
    selects the decision checks. In `test/rbs-seed/`, `# spinel: rbs-seed-run`
    selects an output check and `# spinel: rbs-seed-check` selects an existing
    named assertion in the RBS harness.
    The other `reject-*` markers select the diagnostic assertion named in
    `reject-test`; `rbs-seed-contradicted-return` selects its grouped refusal
    check, and `infer-ivar-get` selects the boxed instance-variable read check.
    A rejection marker followed by `: text` supplies the literal diagnostic
    text to match. In `test/defer/`, `# spinel: defer-refusals: count:output`
    gives the refusal count and stdout, with output lines separated by spaces.
    The ordinary corpus, `test/share/*.rb`, `test/share_strings_*.rb` and
    `test/share/refuse/*.rb` are still discovered by name. Keep `int64` on
    its own first line when needed; platform and overflow exclusions still
    apply.
- **Function size.**
  - A function over 1,000 lines does not grow: add a new arm through a
    helper, or in the file for its receiver type.
  - `emit_call_body` only shrinks (#7033).
- **C style.** Helpers are functions, not Ruby-style macros. Generated C
  puts `else` on its own line, not `} else {`. GNU extensions go through
  `sp_compat.h`. `lib/spinel_rt.h` changes are additive only.
- **Mutable Strings (#6179, #6765).** While the share-by-default prototype
  is in progress, a route that silently copies a String a callee appends to
  should be refused at compile time. Please do not add new per-route
  sharing rules.

## Stacked pull requests

If one pull request depends on another, say so in its description, and
keep the shared commits identical (same SHAs) in both, so merging one
brings the other in cleanly.
