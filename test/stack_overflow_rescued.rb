# A C stack that runs out is CRuby's SystemStackError, and a program that
# rescues it goes on running. Spinel died on SIGSEGV instead: the fault was
# read as an ordinary segfault, and nothing named the stack. The fault handler
# recognizes the thread's own guard now and raises through the exception slots
# -- it runs on the alternate signal stack, so the raise touches none of the
# memory the overflow just ran off the end of, and it allocates nothing (the
# allocator is not safe to re-enter from a signal).
