# A yielding method is spliced at its call site, and a String parameter it
# appends to, or hands to another call, binds as an alias of the caller's
# variable. One the body only reads followed the block's rebinding of that
# variable: `m(u) { u = "k" }` showed "k" where the parameter still holds
# the String it was given. Such a parameter now takes the argument's value
# at the call wherever something can assign the variable while the body
# runs: the call's block (at any depth, by any write kind), a proc that
# captures the variable, or, for a global, any write that can run then (the
# alias was refused there). The same holds for an instance variable the
# block assigns. Integer, Array and object parameters bind by value already.
