# A String a method appends to is the caller's String, and Spinel lends the
# caller's slot to the parameter that takes it (the byref out-param). Two
# binders lent a copy instead. A call whose count the run time decides (a
# splat with an argument after it) binds every positional out of one gathered
# Array, so a String written ahead of the splat went into a temp; and a bare
# `super` inside a block passed the method's captured parameter as a temp of
# its value where a call there passes the capture's cell. Each probe appends
# LONG, which always reallocates, and prints what the caller's name sees.
# spinel: gc-minor
