# Flag-only. Each String below reaches a second name through a flow the
# share analysis did not follow: a pattern binding, a global alias, or a
# builtin that keeps what it is handed (Hash.new's default and block,
# Enumerator.new's yielder, an OpenStruct's fields, zip's pairs, flatten's
# elements, instance_eval's ivars). share_strings_break_values.rb has the
# break and next values. The analysis neither
# joined the two names nor treated the flow as unknown, so each held its
# own copy and a change through one did not show through the other. Each
# case runs in a method of its own, so no other case's names join its own.

# a pattern binds a part of the value it matches, or the whole of it
