# Under --share-strings the rule can convert a typed String Array to the
# poly Array only once the analysis is past its inference fixpoint: a call
# bound late joins the Array's elements with what the walk does not
# follow. Pathname's split_str (`out = []; ... out.push(part); out`)
# answered that Array through an sp_StrArray * return, and its callers'
# locals kept the typed form, so the C did not build. The conversion is a
# late widening the method's return, the locals written from it and the
# reads of each converted local now follow; `words` is one only read, never
# returned. These lines are what it took for the requires to bring the
# conversion about.
