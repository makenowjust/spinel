# The share facts ask is_lazy_name of every call's name, and a call a desugar made has none:
# this program crashed the compiler under --share-strings (a null name in the lazy scan).
# SPINEL_SCHED_STATS=1 reports when the program ends with `exit` or an
# uncaught exception, not only when main returns -- and once when main
# returns, where the drain and the exit hook both run. The test runs itself
# as a child and counts the reports on the child's stderr. CRuby has no such
# report, so there the answer is 1 without looking.
