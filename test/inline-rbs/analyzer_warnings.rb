# Inline RBS the parser maps but the compiler cannot apply: each type names a

# Each is reported at its comment's line and column, in the types as written,
# and nothing of it is applied: the C is the C of the same program compiled
# with --no-inline-rbs. (warnings.rb holds the ones the parser reports.)
