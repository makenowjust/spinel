# win32.mk -- the native Windows build: MinGW-w64 gcc against the UCRT, as
# MSYS2 and RubyInstaller's Devkit ship it. common.mk includes this file when
# $(OS) is Windows_NT, or when CC is a *-w64-mingw32-* cross compiler (the
# compile-only check: `make CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc bin/spinel
# lib/libspinel_rt.a` on Linux); on every other host the PLATFORM_ variables
# it sets are empty and none of it is read.
#
# The runtime is written against POSIX. lib/win32 holds the POSIX surface
# MinGW leaves out or answers differently (see lib/win32/sp_win32.h): every
# compile sees it ahead of MinGW's own headers, and its objects go into the
# runtime archives and the compiler. Programs link statically, so one needs
# no MinGW DLL beside it.

# the rules below are read before the Makefile's own: `make` alone is still
# `make all`
.DEFAULT_GOAL := all

# there is no `cc`
