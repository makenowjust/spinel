# respond_to? audit: for every (family, name) pair src/builtin_ops.c's
# bop_rows actually registers, does a BOXED sample receiver's
# respond_to?(:name) (lib/spinel_rt.h's sp_poly_responds_builtin) agree
# with CRuby's own answer?
#
#   ruby tools/respond_to_audit.rb [--ref RUBY]
#
# This exists because sp_poly_responds_builtin's per-class tables are a
# second, hand-maintained copy of what bop_rows already says is
# implemented (lib/spinel_rt.h's "uni"/"enumm"/"arrm"/"hashm"/"strm"/
# "numm"/"intm"/"fltm"/"rngm"/"symm"/"procm"/"excm" arrays), and nothing
# enforces the two stay in sync. They drifted once already: Array's table
# alone was missing 67 real methods, including every bang mutator (uniq!,
# sort!, compact!, ...), which is exactly the shape of bug gem "jaccard"
# hit for real (Jaccard.coefficient's `union.uniq! if
# union.respond_to?(:uniq!)` silently stopped deduping once `union` was
# boxed). Every sample receiver below is deliberately forced boxed (read
# back out of a 2-element mixed Array) for that reason: a CONCRETE,
# non-boxed receiver's respond_to? answer comes from an entirely
# different, unrelated mechanism (respond_to_static_answer /
# rt_probe_answer in src/codegen_call.c, which has its own gaps --
# tally/to_set/transform_keys!/unicode_normalize at least, found while
# writing this script -- tracked separately, NOT fixed here).
#
# Scope: all 9 classes sp_poly_responds_builtin branches on -- Array,
# Hash, String, Integer, Float, Range, Symbol, Proc, Exception. Exception's
# per-subclass accessors (errno, key, receiver, name, result, ...) are
# gated at runtime by sp_exc_is_a (the boxed exception's own ancestor
# walk), not by a flat name list, since bop_rows has no owning-subclass
# field and a KeyError genuinely has #key while a plain RuntimeError does
# not; each family's FIRST sample in BuiltinRowGen::FAMILIES is a generic
# one (brp_key_error for Exception), so this only probes the names every
# exception shares -- the subclass-specific ones are covered by
# test/respond_to_builtin_mutator_surface.rb instead, not by this script.
# File/Queue/Mutex/Time/Regexp/MatchData/Random/Method/Enumerator/
# Rational/Complex go through other mechanisms (sp_io_typed_responds, or
# are not branched here at all) and are out of scope for this script.
# Rows tagged BOP_IVAR_LESS (compiler-internal reflection helpers like
# __bivar_get, never real Ruby-level methods) are excluded by name
# pattern, not by kind, since BOP_IVAR_LESS is shared with TY_INT/
# TY_STRING's real rows in BuiltinRowGen::FAMILIES.
#
# This is NOT a generator: a mismatch here means a human edits
# lib/spinel_rt.h's tables by hand, the same way the fix that prompted
# this script did. Generating the tables from bop_rows outright hits real
# obstacles (bop_rows is not complete for Range/Symbol -- their surface is
# desugared through Enumerable rather than a row per name -- and Exception
# registers subclass-specific accessors like `errno` with no "owning
# subclass" field to gate them); see RENCANA_GENERATE_RESPOND_TO_TABLE.md
# for that larger, separately-scoped plan.
#
# Exit status: 0 everyone agrees, 1 a mismatch, 4 the tool's own error.
