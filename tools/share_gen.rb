# A case is one row of FACTORS: what holds a mutable String first, the
# route that carries it to a second name, the mutation made through one of
# the two names, the read that observes them, how the String was made, and
# whether spinel compiles the program with --share-strings.
#
# In CRuby every name a String reaches holds the same object, so a mutation
# through one name is seen through every other. Spinel copies a String by
# default and refuses the programs whose answer a copy would change; under
# --share-strings (#6765) a String the share facts share is held as one
# `sp_String *` handle by every holder. Its answer is wrong wherever some
# value route between two holders passes a copy instead of the handle: the
# mutation through one name is then lost to the other, without a word.
# Such routes were found one at a time by hand (`then`, `tap`, a `begin`
# value, `+s`, `String(s)`, a method value through `map` or `Thread#value`,
# `catch`/`throw`, an exception's message, `Array.new(n, s)` ...), so the
# probe crosses every route with every holder, and each mutation and read
# with both. The copying routes (`dup`, `clone`, `String.new`, and `+s` of a
# frozen String) are routes too: there the second name must NOT see the
# mutation, and a route that hands over the handle where CRuby copies is
# wrong the other way.
#
# Each case is a class of its own (`SP<id>`, with the helper classes and
# methods its route needs; every method, variable, attribute and member
# name it defines outside a method body carries its id, so the cases of one
# program share no name the analysis joins on). Its `run` puts the String
# in its holder, carries it to a local `t`, prints the observer's read of
# both names, mutates one of them (printing `ok` or the class of what the
# mutation raised: a frozen String raises FrozenError through both), prints
# the observer again, then `p` of both names, and for `force_encoding`
# their encodings. The source name is read again through its holder each
# time (`a[0]`, `o.v<id>`, `@@s<id>`), so an element or a member that lost
# the handle shows as well as the local. A difference is named by the role
# of the line that differs: the last `p` when it does (`value: value@1` is
# a mutation through the holder the second name did not see), else the
# first line that differs.
#
# Every row is also compiled in the other mode (share_probe.rb runs each
# case with and without --share-strings), so a finding's `mode` says whether
# the answer is wrong under the flag, without it, or both.
